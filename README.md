## Architectural Technologist
Only during my studies to become an Architectural Technologist have I realized: It's not just bricks and mortar anymore, but also bits and bytes!
I started my digital journey by learning Excel back in 2018 and am now nerding around in different programming languages.

My AEC related repositories:
* [pyRevit LoadFamily bundle](https://github.com/hikmet-kibar/LoadFamilies.pushbutton)
  :zap: Pulled into the official pyRevit repository and will be published with v4.8.4!
<!--* [Computational Design In Blender](https://github.com/hikmet-kibar/parametric-camp) -->

## Sharing Is Caring
I keep most of my work public for others to peek in, copy, change, and learn from my mistakes.
I learned thanks to others willingness of sharing knowledge/work and this is my way of giving back to the community. So feel free to browse through my repositories!

## Currently Working On
* Learning Go
* Learning about computational/parametric design using Blender + Python 
* Uploading construction projects to GitHub
* Contributing to AEC projects
